Simple Real-Time Weather App
===
In this mini-project, I will be building a weather website with Node.js, Express, Open Weather that allows users type in a city name and get real-time weather data instantly displated on their screen.

* Run the web app locally:
```
node server.js
// Now open your browser and visit: localhost:3000
```
